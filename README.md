# Neon Genessis
An operational system written just for study, I don't think it will ever scale
to be more than a kernel to be honest. Yes the project nomenclatures are based
on the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion...

OS: Neon Genesis
  Kernel:         Adam
  LibC:           Lilith
  Processess:     ???

# Technicals
This project uses **Clang** for compilation, **Nix** for package
management, the architecture used is i686-elf and the boot standard
is multiboot2 currently but I plan on moving to the limine boot
standard.
